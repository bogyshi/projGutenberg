PERCENT COMPLETE:
83%

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
part 5

BUGS:
1
Dates that have an improper format are ignored, could be fixed to include the only information available

FILES:
exploration/main.py
exploration/book.py
logistics/moveBooks.py

NOTES:
All books were retrieved using the following command.
wget -w 1 -m -H "http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest?filetypes[]=txt"

Files were then adjusted using the two scripts present in the logistics directory.
First moveBooks, then unzipBooks.
unzipBooks.py assumes a directory titles "ASCII" exists in the same directory as to where the zips are stored.

My tests were run on 1800+ txt files

My solution to the "Most dialogue" is multi faceted and imperfect. I tried several different heurisitcs.

The single and double quote captures were my first thought. This failed quickly. Different languages such as dutch and french
use them a lot for their grammars.

The most promising results are using the New Line Ratio(NLR), which represent the number of blank lines to the total number of lines
A high ratio means the document follows a structure similar to most scripts/plays, which contain a lot of dialogue.

FUTURE WORK:
Improve part 5 by using language heuristics, ex "he said ...", or in french "--"..., which indicates dialogue from time to time

TO RUN:
